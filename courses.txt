The course tool is used to learn the necessary knowledge from the study guide in order to properly use the training tool. Nothing done in the course menu has any effect on your proficiency points for a given subject. The quiz after the course is different, giving you multiple chances to find the correct answer. It can also be considered a more zoned-in practice tool as the questions only pull from questions related to course content.
