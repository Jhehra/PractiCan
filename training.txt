The training tool is a system to give you questions to enhance and reinforce your understanding of potential concepts on the Canadian Citizenship Test. If you are not logged in, you will receive a random question each time and there are no changes in proficiency points. If you are logged in, you will receive a question from the category with the lowest proficiency points, and if you get the answer right, your proficiency points for that subject will increase.
